This is a reference implementation to demonstrate the integration of
pre-processing components from [Reynolds](https://github.com/dmsurti/reynolds)
to build a GUI for the pre-processing steps of [OpenFoam](http://openfoam.com).

This reference implemenation uses Blender and is based on the following
constraint:

1. Write Blender add-ons with standalone operators that invoke the Reynolds
   API.
